-- 0087: the join of parity4, first part (tasks 130 and 131; 129 brings its own join file, 0088; 132 needs none: 0086 adds no
-- table and no function purge() or apply_roles() must name),
-- built from 0082's purge() and 0069's apply_roles() (never edited by hand).
-- purge() re-created with four more monthly partition parents - mssql_indexlock_read, mssql_indexlock_sample,
-- mssql_proc_read and mssql_proc_sample (0084, task 130) - and one more retention step, pgvigil.mssql_reads_purge
-- (0084: the property change history past the window and the counters of an instance not read within it).
-- apply_roles() re-created with mssql_reads_purge on the owner-only list: it deletes, so a reader must not hold
-- EXECUTE on it (the branch that takes back a grant an earlier run gave does so here too); migrate calls
-- apply_roles() after the last file as before. 0085 (task 131) adds no table that grows by the month and re-creates
-- the view alert_findings itself (findings UNION ALL alert_rule_findings): nothing of it is repeated here, and
-- pgvigil.findings does not take alert_rule_findings.
